Linux & MacOs:

  python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  
The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol ; but you may manually execute them one after another.

Create the Python's virtual environment that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
Activate the Python's virtual environment so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
